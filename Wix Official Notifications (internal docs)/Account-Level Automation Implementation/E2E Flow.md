# Account-Level E2E Flow: Implementation Guide

This guide walks you through implementing account-level automations, including trigger setup, automation creation, testing, and publishing.

---

## üåü Overview

**Account-level automations** are used for sending notifications to users, regardless of individual site context. for more information about account level automations read the [Introduction](https://github.com/Pickman123/Private-Projects/blob/main/Wix%20Official%20Notifications%20(internal%20docs)/Introduction%20to%20Wix%20Official%20Notifications.md)

this docs include the steps you should do in order to create account level automation

1. Create an Automation Trigger
2. Test trigger
3. Create Preinstalled Automation
4. Test preinstalled Automation
5. Rollout

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Automation Trigger

Account-level triggers can be implemented using one of the following methods:

- **Auto-Converted Trigger from Event:**  
  Use a server event (Legacy or DE) containing all relevant account/user data.  
  See: [Auto-Converted Triggers From Events](./Triggers/Auto-Converted%20Triggers%20From%20Events%20(Account%20level).md)

- **Quix Job Trigger:**  
  Trigger automations for multiple users/accounts based on rows in a Quix job.  
  See: [Creating Trigger From Quix Job](./Triggers/Creating%20Trigger%20From%20Quix%20Job.md)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test trigger

- Thoroughly test account-level triggers to ensure your automation works end-to-end before release.
- Ensure the relevant feature toggle (`ft-...`, provided separately) is enabled for test environment.  

### 2.1: Install Your App on the Test Site

- Use the **"Test Your App"** feature in Dev Center to install your app on the dedicated test site:  
  *msid:* `eb2f2d49-b70f-4b9d-9055-4cc9793aca5e`
  
  ![Install App for test](../../images/Install%20app%20for%20test.png?raw=true)

  *Notes:*
  - If you are not a collaborator, contact [#Automations-platform](https://wix.slack.com/archives/C7F2DUC1Y).
  - If the app is already installed, you do not need to install it again.

### 2.2: Create an Automation with Your Trigger

- On the test site, create a new automation with your account-level trigger‚Äîany automation you prefer‚Äîand verify that it runs successfully.

### 2.3: Manually Run the Trigger

- **For Auto-Converted Triggers:**  
  Initiate the trigger manually and verify that it runs successfully. 
- **For Quix-Based Triggers:**  
 In the Quix Job settings, choose the Testing configuration for your automation action, then initiate it from there.

### 2.4: When satisfied, publish the trigger.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Preinstalled Automation
Create the automation - define its logic, triggers, conditions, and notifications, and configure the accompanying pre-installed component.
Install the pre-installed component (with the app) only on production and test sites to ensure a controlled, correct rollout.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test preinstalled Automation

Thoroughly test the preinstalled component to ensure your automation works end-to-end before release.
Ensure the relevant feature toggle (`ft-...`, provided separately) is enabled for test environment.   

### 4.1: Install Your App on the Test Site

- Use the **"Test Your App"** feature in Dev Center to install your app on the dedicated test site:  
  *msid:* `eb2f2d49-b70f-4b9d-9055-4cc9793aca5e`
  
  ![Install App for test](../../images/Install%20app%20for%20test.png?raw=true)

  *Notes:*
  - If you are not a collaborator, contact [#Automations-platform](https://wix.slack.com/archives/C7F2DUC1Y).
  - If the app is already installed, you do not need to install it again.

### 4.2: Find your preinstalled in the automations page

Find your preinstalled automation under "installed for you" tab in the table

### 4.3: Manually Run the Preinstalled

- **For Auto-Converted Triggers:**  
  Initiate the trigger manually and verify that it runs successfully. 
- **For Quix-Based Triggers:**  
 In the Quix Job settings, choose the Testing configuration for your automation action, then initiate it from there.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Rollout Time! 

üéâ Your account-level automation is ready for a gradual rollout and finalization. To do that:

- Include the production site (*msid:* `3dee5be0-fd3c-427a-8202-e74f27f7e8a5`) in your component spec
- Turned Off the Test env feature toggle (`ft-...`, provided separately)
- Publish your dev center app
- (identity team missing info about gradual rollout)
