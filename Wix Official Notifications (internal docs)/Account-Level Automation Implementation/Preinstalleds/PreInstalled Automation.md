# Create Preinstalled Automation Component (account level)

## üåü Overview

This guide covers the creation of the automation itself‚Äîincluding logic, triggers, conditions, and email notifications‚Äîas well as the setup of the pre-installed component.

For account-level automations, the pre-installed component (along with the app) must be installed only on the production and test sites. This ensures correct deployment and controlled rollout.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Base Automation

**What is base automation?**  
This is the core automation configuration that defines the logic, structure, and messaging of the automation.  
**Important note:** This automation should be reused every time the pre-installed automation is updated.

### Steps

1. Go to your Dev Center app and navigate to the automations page.

   *Note: If you don't yet have a dedicated app for account-level automations, make sure to follow our [prerequisites guide](https://github.com/Pickman123/Private-Projects/blob/main/Wix%20Official%20Notifications%20(internal%20docs)/Prerequisites%20for%20Sending%20Wix%20Official%20Notifications.md).*

2. Click on Create New Preinstalled Components, and select your dedicated site where you manage your base automations in order to create a new one.
   
   *Note: Look for your team site here: [Team Sites List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nlqcgy7C_8N5t0FsUWgLDB3nfQhNZbV-YSw4IZ9zr7U/edit?gid=0#gid=0).  
   If you don't have one, reach out in #automation platform.*

5. Implement the user-type conditional template routing (Required for Email Sending)

   Add to the automation a single condition that will route the user to the right email design according to user-type (Studio or Classic account). User-type data is available by default, so no additional setup is required.

   Any other functionality or logic can be implemented in this part according to your needs.

### 1.2 Set the automation notification.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Rollout Spec

- Generate a spec (feature toggle) with your scope in [Guinipig ‚Üí](https://wix-bo.com/dev/feature-toggle?viewId=views).
- Set it to true for the dedicated test site (**msid:** `eb2f2d49-b70f-4b9d-9055-4cc9793aca5e`)  
  This will control rollout and prevent the component from being downloaded on the production site if the app is already installed.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Export the Base Automation into the Preinstalled Automation Component

- Generate a link from the automation table.
- The link includes a reference to the automation configuration and will be used to create or update the pre-installed component.
