# Test preinstalled Automation

- Thoroughly test the preinstalled component to ensure your automation works end-to-end before release.
- Ensure the relevant feature toggle (`ft-...`, provided separately) is enabled for test environment.

### 1️⃣ Install Your App on the Test Site

  *Notes:*

  - If the app is already installed, you do not need to install it again.
