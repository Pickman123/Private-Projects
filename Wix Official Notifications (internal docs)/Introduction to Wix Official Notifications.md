## Account-Level vs. Site-Level Automations

Understanding whether an automation operates at the **account level** or **site level** is essential, as it affects implementation, design, and data flow.

---

### Site-Level Automations

Site-level automations are triggered by events specific to individual sites.

**Examples:**
- An order is placed on a site ‚Üí Order confirmation email is sent.
- A new collaborator is added to a site ‚Üí Invitation email is sent.

---

### Account-Level Automations

Account-level automations are associated with the unified Wix account, which can span multiple workspaces or sites. Users within an account can collaborate across workspaces, and certain actions or settings apply universally at the account level.

**Examples:**
- A user clicks ‚ÄúReset Password‚Äù ‚Üí Password reset email is sent.
- A payment method is updated for a workspace ‚Üí Billing notification is sent to the account owner.

## Automation Logic & Key Differences

This section explains how automations are implemented under the hood and highlights the core differences between site-level and account-level automation logic.

### Site-Level Automation Logic

- Automations are defined in a pre-installed automation component under a Dev Center app.  
- This component is automatically installed on every site where the app is present.  
- Site-level automations and the notifications they generate are triggered by site-specific events and are sent to the site owner or other collaborators.  
- These automations run invisibly in the background and are not exposed or editable by users.

### Account-Level Automation Logic

- Account-level automations are defined in a pre-installed automation component under a Dev Center app.  
- This app, along with its automation component, is installed only on a single production site and a dedicated test site.  
- The production site is responsible for triggering all account-level automations and sending the corresponding notifications to users.

#### Key Differences

- **Installation Scope:**  
  - Site-level logic is installed on every site with the app.  
  - Account-level logic is installed only on a production site and a test site.
- **Triggering Events:**  
  - Site-level automations are triggered by events specific to each site.  
  - Account-level automations are triggered by actions at the account level, spanning multiple sites or workspaces.
- **Visibility & Editability:**  
  - Both automation types run in the background and are not exposed to users, but account-level automations centralize their logic and notification sending.
